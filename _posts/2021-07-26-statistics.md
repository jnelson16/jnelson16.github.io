On page 2 of the Ohio Department of Transportation's [_Motorcycle Operator Manual_](https://publicsafety.ohio.gov/static/mop0001.pdf), we find the following line:

> Most crashes happen on short trips (less than five miles long), just a few minutes after starting out.

This is most likely a _true_ statement (though I was not able to find accident data based on trip length), but it is not something that that someone trained in statistics should find particularly interesting. Here's why.

The statement is talking about the total number of crashes by motorcyclists, not the likelihood of a crash for any particular ride. It is not saying that you are _more likely_ to crash on a short trip, just that most crashes, a statisical majority, happen on short trips.

This is not statistically interesting because most trips are short trips. Though I was not able to find data on the distribution of lengths of trips, we can assume that most trips on motorcycles are probably not long.
